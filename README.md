# Face-Recognition-based-Security-System

In this project we intend to create a reliable and efficient security system which should also be inexpensive and user friendly. There are basically two scenarios on which we have based this project i.e. authorized access and unauthorized access. 
To differentiate between the two we are performing a face recognition algorithm to match the user’s face with the registered face in the system. For this we are using a neural network and keras based algorithm which detects user’s face and matches it with the pre-registered faces. 
If the faces match the door will be opened for the user but if the faces don’t match we deploy a alert SMS to the owner of the house, the door is kept closed and an alarm is set off at the door in form of a high intensity buzzer to alert the neighbourhood to identify the unauthorized user trying to enter the house. 
So using this simple if-else situation in the scenario we are going to secure the house for the owner. The aim was to design a simple and effective system which we were able to achieve with this prototype.
We have used the following applications to develop this prototype:
1.	Google Colab
2.	Tinkercad
3.	ThingSpeak
4.	Twilio
